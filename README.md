# ⚛️ React webpack boilerplate

## 🔲 App structure

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

- `src/index.html` page template;
- `src/index.js` JavaScript entry point.

## 🚧 Install the dependencies


```
$ cd project
$ npm install
```

## 🚀 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Launches the webpack-dev-server and starts the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

## Dev config
There are prettier code formating rules set inside package.json file for use with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) inside your code editor.
