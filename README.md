# ⚛️ React webpack boilerplate

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/vr1e).

## 🔲 App structure

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

- `src/index.html` page template;
- `src/index.js` JavaScript entry point.

## 🚧 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Launches the webpack-dev-server and starts the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
